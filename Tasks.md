## ðŸ”§ Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Run development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Or using the entry point
python main.py
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Initialize Alembic (when ready)
alembic init alembic

# Create migration
